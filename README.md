# Computer-Vision

In this project, I developed a deep learning pipeline to classify 107 distinct yoga poses from image data. The dataset was organized into training, validation, and test sets, each containing labeled images for every pose. I performed data preprocessing, including normalization and augmentation, to improve model generalization. A custom CNN was built using Keras, and the model was trained with various techniques such as Batch Normalization, Dropout, L2 Regularization, Early Stopping, and Learning Rate Scheduling.

I experimented with different architectures and optimizers, tracked training metrics using TensorBoard, and evaluated models using accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix. The best-performing model was further optimized and quantized using TensorFlow Lite for potential deployment in a mobile fitness app.
